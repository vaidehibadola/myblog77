             <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface
             in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer
             with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system
             used to control one or more servers.</p>
             
            <p> Console is a basic computer or monitor and keyboard that is 
             connected to another computer, server, or a mainframe over a network. It is used to maintain or 
             monitor the status of the network or computer.</p>

            <p>You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console 
             log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to 
             the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then
             click Console.</p>
